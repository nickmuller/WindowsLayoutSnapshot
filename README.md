# WindowsLayoutSnapshot

Ever switch monitor configs on your laptop and all of your windows are squished down in size and in the wrong position? Ever want to minimize all windows but save their layouts and min-max'ed states for later?

WindowsLayoutSnapshot is a windows app to remember and restore window positions.


#### Features
- Check the list of snapshots when you click on the tray menu icon. Left click to restore the snapshot, right click to delete.
- Automatically taken snapshots are shown in normal text. Manually taken snapshots (`Take Snapshot`) command are shown in **bold**.
- Snapshots are stored across app restarts.
- Snapshots support multiple windows of the same application (like Chrome instances).
- The app takes a "snapshot" of your windows layout before every screen lock.
